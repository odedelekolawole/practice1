    <h1>Hi, I'm Kolawole Odedele</h1>

    <hr />
    <p>
    Hello! I'am Kolawole Odedele, a full-Stack sofware developer. i started
    pursuing my passion in the world of tech in the early months of year 2022. i
    have always have passion to be a software developer forn a long time. but
    due to my former profession, i have not been able to give it my 100%
    attention, as combining Engineering Geology with Software development could
    be so demanding and tasking, but earliy last year, the year 2022, where a
    was at the juction of making a big career decision in-between the two
    position that i found myself. I needed to make a quick decison on either to
    firther my academic in the field of geology by applying for master degree or
    to use the fund and the time available for to switch career to tech. this is
    a decision i needded to make within a week, else i might not have the
    opportunity to to that any longer
